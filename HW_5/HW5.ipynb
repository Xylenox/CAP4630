One way to deal with overfitting is to change the training data a bit, such as rotating or scaling images. Another way is to add a dropout layer, which removes a few nodes in the network each time it trains. Also, making sure to get redundant input features is important.\n",

        "Underfitting is when the model is not complex enough to fit the data. The model either doesn't have very good accuracy on the train data or it takes a long time to train. The way to fix this is to just increase the complexity of the model."

Since these are trained on a large database of images, they are very generalized. Then, you can attach your own classifier to it. The conv base should be locked from training, or else it might change dramatically during the initial training.\n",
